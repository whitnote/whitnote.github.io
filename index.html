		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I&#39;m a digital marketing and public relations manager, living in Minneapolis. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I started as a copy writer for websites and gradually became interested in how the larger process worked. Today, I am responsible for developing my company&#39;s website strategy, interviewing dev agencies and project managing the builds and maintenance. I have 6 websites currently either in construction or about to undergo complete redesigns.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
